       "    *   **Pros:**  Versatile (works on gas or electric stoves), relatively fast, can boil larger quantities than electric kettles (depending on the kettle size).  Often more durable than electric kettles.\n",
       "    *   **Cons:** Requires monitoring (can boil dry if forgotten), slower than electric kettles for smaller volumes.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Microwave:**\n",
       "    *   **Pros:**  Very fast for small amounts, convenient.\n",
       "    *   **Cons:** Uneven heating (can lead to superheated water that explodes when disturbed – *be careful!*), can impart a plastic taste to the water (if using plastic containers), not suitable for large quantities, potentially dangerous superheating can cause burns. Not all materials are microwave safe.\n",
       "\n",

       "**Why the Sky is Blue**\n",
       "\n",
       "The sky is blue due to a phenomenon called **Rayleigh scattering**. Here's the simplified explanation:\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  **Sunlight enters the atmosphere:** Sunlight is made up of all the colors of the rainbow.\n",
       "\n",
       "2.  **Light interacts with air molecules:**  As sunlight passes through the Earth's atmosphere, it collides with tiny air molecules (mostly nitrogen and oxygen).\n",
       "\n",
       "3.  **Scattering occurs:**  This collision causes the light to scatter in different directions.\n",
       "\n",
       "4.  **Blue light scatters more:**  Shorter wavelengths of light (blue and violet) are scattered *much* more effectively than longer wavelengths (red, orange, yellow).  This is because the amount of scattering is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the wavelength.  (Rayleigh scattering intensity ∝ 1/λ⁴).  This \"fourth power\" relationship is crucial; it means a small difference in wavelength results in a large difference in scattering.\n",
       "\n",
       "5.  **Why not violet?**  While violet light is scattered even *more* than blue light, several factors contribute to the sky appearing blue rather than violet:\n",
       "    *   The sun emits less violet light than blue light.\n",
       "    *   The atmosphere absorbs some violet light.\n",
       "    *   Our eyes are more sensitive to blue light than violet light.\n",
       "\n",
       "6.  **We see blue:**  Because blue light is scattered more, it's spread across the sky.  When we look up, we see this scattered blue light coming from all directions, making the sky appear blue.\n",
       "\n",
       "**In essence, Rayleigh scattering favors the scattering of shorter wavelengths, and blue light is scattered more effectively than other colors in the visible spectrum. That's why we see a blue sky.**\n"

       "**For Energy Efficiency:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Electric Kettle (with variable temperature):** Similar to above, but with the added benefit of setting the exact temperature you need, which can save energy if you don't always need a rolling boil (e.g., for delicate teas).\n",
       "*   **Induction Cooktop with a Stainless Steel Kettle:** Induction is highly efficient, as the heat is directly generated within the kettle itself.\n",
       "\n",
       "**For Convenience:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Electric Kettle:** Again, the winner. Easy to use, automatic shut-off, and cordless pouring.\n",
       "*   **Stovetop Kettle (with whistle):** Provides an audible alert when boiling, which is convenient if you're multitasking.\n",

       "*   **Camp Stove (Gas or Liquid Fuel):**  Essential for boiling water while camping or during power outages.\n",
       "*   **Open Fire (with a suitable pot):** The most basic method, but requires careful fire management.\n",
       "\n",
       "**For Large Volumes of Water:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Large Stovetop Pot:**  Good for boiling water for pasta or other large-scale cooking needs.  Gas stovetops are often better for larger volumes.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Factors to Consider:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Amount of Water:** For a small amount (1-2 cups), an electric kettle is ideal. For larger amounts, a stovetop pot might be more efficient.\n",
       "*   **Energy Source:** Electric, gas, induction, wood, etc.  Choose the method that uses the energy source you have readily available.\n",
       "*   **Budget:** Electric kettles can range in price. Stovetop pots are generally more affordable.\n",
       "*   **Purpose:** If you need very precise temperature control (e.g., for specific teas), an electric kettle with temperature settings is best.\n",
       "*   **Safety:** Electric kettles have automatic shut-off features, which help prevent accidents. Be careful when boiling water on a stovetop or open fire.\n",
       "\n",
       "**In summary, if you're looking for the best overall method for everyday use:**\n",

       "Okay, as a high school student looking to learn a programming language, I strongly recommend **(a) learn Python** or **(b) learn JavaScript**, depending on your specific interests. I would advise against learning Fortran for now. Here's a breakdown:\n",
       "\n",
       "**Recommendation: Python or JavaScript**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Python:**\n",
       "    *   **Pros:**\n",
       "        *   **Beginner-Friendly:**  Python's syntax is designed to be readable and easy to understand, almost like plain English. This makes it an excellent choice for beginners.\n",
       "        *   **Versatile:**  Python is used in a wide range of applications, including:\n",
       "            *   **Data Science/Machine Learning:** A very popular field right now. Python has extensive libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn for data analysis, visualization, and machine learning. This could give you a significant advantage if you're interested in these areas.\n",
       "            *   **Web Development:** Python can be used for backend web development (using frameworks like Django or Flask).\n",
       "            *   **Scripting/Automation:**  Python is great for automating tasks, writing scripts, and creating utilities.\n",
       "            *   **Game Development:**  Pygame is a popular library for creating simple games.\n",
       "            *   **Education:** many schools use Python in coding classes, so having a prior understanding would be beneficial in future courses.\n",
       "        *   **Large and Supportive Community:**  Python has a huge online community, meaning you'll find plenty of tutorials, documentation, and help when you get stuck.\n",
       "        *   **Job Market:** Python skills are in high demand in many industries.\n",
       "    *   **Cons:**\n",
       "        *   Can be slower than some other languages (like C++ or Java) for performance-critical applications.  But this is usually not a concern for beginners or most general-purpose tasks.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **JavaScript:**\n",
       "    *   **Pros:**\n",
       "        *   **Web Development:**  JavaScript is *essential* for front-end web development. It's what makes websites interactive (e.g., animations, dynamic content, handling user input). If you're interested in creating websites, this is a must-learn.\n",
       "        *   **Full-Stack Development:**  With Node.js, you can also use JavaScript for back-end development, allowing you to build entire web applications using a single language.\n",
       "        *   **Ubiquitous:**  JavaScript runs in web browsers, making it incredibly accessible. You can start coding in JavaScript right away using your browser's developer tools.\n",
       "        *   **Large and Supportive Community:** Similar to Python, JavaScript has a massive online community and tons of resources available.\n",
       "        *   **Popular Frameworks:**  JavaScript has powerful frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js, which are widely used in the industry. Learning these frameworks can significantly boost your career prospects.\n",
       "    *   **Cons:**\n",
       "        *   Can be a bit more complex to learn initially than Python, especially when dealing with asynchronous programming and the intricacies of the web browser environment.\n",
       "        *   JavaScript's behavior can sometimes be inconsistent across different browsers (though this is less of a problem than it used to be).\n",
       "\n",
       "**Why NOT Fortran:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Fortran:**\n",
       "    *   **Pros:**\n",
       "        *   **Scientific Computing:** Fortran is still used in some areas of scientific and engineering computing, particularly for legacy code or highly performance-critical numerical simulations.\n",
       "    *   **Cons:**\n",
       "        *   **Not Beginner-Friendly:** Fortran's syntax can be less intuitive than Python or JavaScript, especially for modern programming concepts.\n",
       "        *   **Limited Applicability:** Fortran's primary use is in a niche area. While valuable in that area, it's not as broadly applicable as Python or JavaScript.\n",
       "        *   **Smaller Community:** The Fortran community is smaller than Python's or JavaScript's, which means fewer online resources and less support available.\n",
       "        *   **Job Market:** The job market for Fortran developers is significantly smaller than for Python or JavaScript developers.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Which to Choose: Python or JavaScript?**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Choose Python if:**\n",
       "    *   You're most interested in data science, machine learning, scripting, automation, or creating simple games.\n",
       "    *   You want a language that's easy to pick up and learn the fundamentals of programming.\n",
       "    *   You prefer a language with a focus on readability and clear syntax.\n",
       "*   **Choose JavaScript if:**\n",
       "    *   You're passionate about web development and creating interactive websites.\n",
       "    *   You want to learn a language that's essential for front-end development and can also be used for back-end development.\n",
       "    *   You're interested in learning popular JavaScript frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js.\n",
       "\n",
       "**My Overall Recommendation:**\n",
       "\n",
       "For a high school student just starting out, **Python is often the best choice**. It's easier to learn, more versatile for general-purpose tasks, and opens doors to many interesting areas like data science and machine learning.  However, if you *know* that your primary interest is in creating websites, then JavaScript is a strong contender.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Ultimately, the best language to learn is the one that excites you the most!**  Try a few tutorials for both Python and JavaScript and see which one you enjoy working with.  Good luck!\n"
